# Downsampled hash sequences

This repository contains experimental code for learning to map sequences of continuously-valued feature vectors to downsampled sequences of binary vectors (hashes).  Beyond the requirements in `setup.py`, it also requires cutting-edge versions of [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano) and [Lasagne](https://github.com/Lasagne/Lasagne).
